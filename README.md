 2) the make a profile (where you choose a display name) also needs to be built with html and css. 
 3) The submit a post button at the bottom of the input form, within the make a post view is broken on mobile (overlapping with footer) and needs to be fixed. 
 4) Im not in love with the nav bar because it is kind of hard to navigate and think it needs TLC from UX.
